Project name: Spock
Programmers: Akash Arora and Chinmai Raman
Code Reviewer: Connor Ford

On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 5 based on the following criteria:

1  At least one of the program has syntax errors and does not compile

2  The programs compile successfully but at least one generates runtime errors

3  The programs compile and run but the project does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically:

4  The programs compile and produce technically correct results but does not follow assignment/class guidelines (e.g. it does not use multithreading) or is insufficiently documented.
Specifically:

5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the code: Work out some of the bugs and handling for incorrect input.
